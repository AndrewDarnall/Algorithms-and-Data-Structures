# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This repo is meant as a reference and a practice for various implementations of algorithms and data structures.
The **__perfect__** reference for algorithms and data structures is [introduction to algorithms 3rd edition](https://sd.blackball.lv/library/Introduction_to_Algorithms_Third_Edition_(2009).pdf).

The programming language choice is pseudo randomic, I was taught algorithms and data structurs in C++, so other languages are used for practice.
